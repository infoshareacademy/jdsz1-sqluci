* STORY
- show different approaches for possible analysis of influencing variables
- make a snapshoot (just a snapshot!) of comparisons
- remark the number of records (especially in time distribution analysis)

* WHAT WAS ANALYZED
- data was cleaned
- average delay time was the main measure
- departure / arrival country as possibly something important in influencing the average delay time
- operator vs departure / arrival country and average time (reject entries with too little records)
