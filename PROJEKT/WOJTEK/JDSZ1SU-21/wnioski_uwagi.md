* STORY
 - show different approaches for possible analysis of influencing variables
 - make a snapshoot (just a snapshot!) of comparisons
 - remark the number of records (especially in time distribution analysis)

* WHAT WAS ANALYZED
 - data was cleaned
 - average delay time was the main measure
 - departure / arrival country as possibly something important in influencing the average delay time
 - operator vs departure / arrival country and average time (reject entries with too little records)
 - #TODO perform tests on average delay among train type, operator type and date
 - #TODO is 74Y, 74H significantly slower?
 - #TODO analysis for delay over 180 min only
 
* RESULTS
 - no basis to analyze the proportions of DY, OT, EY as there are almost none reocords of non CX and non DY
 - take look at WYLOT-PRZYLOT - for example flights form Canada, or Mexico to Italy
 - 330 train type is absolutely the slowest
